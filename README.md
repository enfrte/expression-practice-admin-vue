# expression-practice-admin-vue

This is the backend for the <insert_language>-expression-practice app - https://github.com/enfrte/finnish-expression-practice 

The UI is in Vue, and it runs locally, using PHP and Apache. Data is saved a json dataset, and the result is meant to update the app's static dataset. 

It's tagged with Vue in the title because I'm still evaluating JS frontend frameworks, and I may write another version in another framework for experience.
